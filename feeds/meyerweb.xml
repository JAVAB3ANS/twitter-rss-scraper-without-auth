      <title>I still smile remembering how one of our kids, when they were a toddler, used to sing:

‚ÄúSpider-Man, Spider-Man
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web any size
Catches bees just like flies
Look out, here comes Spider-Man‚Äù

‚Ä¶over and over.

(I absolutely did not correct them.)</title>

No idea how long and how much adjustment it will take to get to acceptance, so not linking it yet.  But still!
